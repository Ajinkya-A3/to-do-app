# to do app 

1. Introduction
This Flask-based To-Do App is a simple yet efficient task management application that allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks. It also includes a dark mode toggle and an undo feature to reverse recent actions. The app ensures a smooth user experience with a modern, responsive UI.

2. Functionalities
Task Management: Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete (strikethrough effect), and remove them.
Undo Feature: Any action (add, complete, remove) can be undone within 5 seconds via an undo message.
Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light and dark themes with smooth transitions.
Non-Persistent Data: Tasks do not persist after refreshing, ensuring a clean slate on each load.

3. Design
Centered UI: The entire interface is centered for a clean and structured layout.
Consistent Styling: Buttons for adding, completing, and removing tasks share a uniform color scheme.
Dark Mode Styling: Smooth transition effects between light and dark themes enhance user experience.
Enhanced Undo UI: The undo message has a larger clickable area, a hover effect, and bold styling for visibility.

4. Implementation
Backend: Built using Flask, providing RESTful APIs for task management.
Frontend: Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive UI.
JavaScript Handling: Manages dynamic task addition, completion, removal, and the undo mechanism.
CSS Styling: Implements modern UI elements with hover effects, transitions, and animations.
